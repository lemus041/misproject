        <h1>My Hobbies & Interests</h1>
        <p>Everyone has different ways of spending their free time and finding what makes them happy. For me, my hobbies are a mix of both excitement and relaxation. I love watching soccer because of the energy, emotion, and sense of connection it brings. On the other hand, I also enjoy going on walks and exploring nature, which helps me slow down and clear my mind after a busy day. Both of these hobbies play an important role in my life because they allow me to balance my love for high-energy moments with my need for peace and reflection.</p>

          <h2>Hobby 1: Soccer</h2>
          <p>Although I really enjoy watching soccer, I am not the best at playing it, so my hobby is focused on being a fan. I love all the emotions that come together when watching a game, including joy, anxiety, suspense, and even frustration when things do not go as planned. I get completely immersed in the matches, and during big tournaments it feels almost as if I am playing on the field myself. My favorite tournament is the World Cup because it brings people from all over the world together to celebrate the sport. I love seeing the incredible performances of the players, the creative outfits and face paint of the fans, and the electric tension that builds with every goal, every close call, and every decisive moment. I also enjoy the sense of community it creates. Watching with friends, family, or even strangers, everyone shares the same excitement and passion for the game. Soccer has taught me to appreciate teamwork, dedication, and the thrill of competition. It has become more than just a sport for me. It is a way to connect with people and experience unforgettable moments.</p>

          <h2>Why Soccer Is Important to Me</h2>
          <p>Growing up, I would always wake up on the weekends to the TV yelling “GOL!” My dad was always watching soccer and became especially loud whenever his favorite team played. I loved seeing his passion for the game, and over time, it began to rub off on me. Now, I feel like a second version of him. When Real Madrid plays, our favorite team, we share the same emotions and react in the same way whenever they score. This passion is important to me because it gives me the chance to have meaningful and enjoyable conversations with my dad about something we both love.</p>

          <h2>Hobby 2: Walking and Nature Exploration</h2>
          <p>In my free time, I really enjoy going on walks, whether it’s by myself or with friends. Spending time outdoors helps me clear my mind and recharge after a long day. One of my favorite parts about walking is getting to take in all the beautiful scenery around me. When I’m in Duluth, I especially love spotting the deer that wander through the woods; it’s always such a peaceful and calming sight. Back home, I often go for walks by a lake that’s near my house. The water, trees, and changing seasons make it a perfect place to unwind and enjoy some quiet time. I also love taking pictures of nature while I’m out on these walks. Capturing photos of sunsets, trees, or wildlife helps me appreciate the little details I might otherwise overlook, and it’s a fun way to remember those peaceful moments outdoors.</p>

          <h2>Why Walking and Nature Exploring Are Important to Me</h2>
          <p>Going on these walks allows me to reconnect with nature and take in all the beauty around me. It helps me step away from my normal routine and reminds me that there’s more to life than just school and homework. When I start to feel overwhelmed or stressed out, walking gives me a break from everything and helps me clear my head. It’s nice to have some time where I don’t have to think about assignments or deadlines and can just focus on being outside. Sometimes I’ll stop to take pictures of the scenery, like the trees, the water, or even animals I see along the way. It’s something simple, but it always helps me feel more relaxed and refreshed afterward.</p>
