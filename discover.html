        <h1>Discover UMD & Duluth</h1>
        <p>The University of Minnesota Duluth is located in Duluth, MN and it is a midsized campus. It is surrounded by nature including one of the Great Lakes that is Lake Superior. There is always something to do in Duluth whether it's going to the beach, going on a hike, or staying in with friends. UMD is a great place to learn and create great memories.</p>

      <h2>Why I Chose UMD</h2>
      <p>After visiting UMD my junior year of high school I knew this is where I wanted to attend. I fell in love with the medium size campus as well as Labovitz School of Business and Economics (LSBE). I also enjoyed the location because it wasn't too close to home nor too far. Lake Superior also caught my eye because of how gorgeous it was and the fact that I could go to the beach when I needed a break. Overall the beauty of the campus really caught my attention.</p>

          <h2>What I Love About Duluth</h2>
          <p>Growing up, I often visited Duluth from Saint Paul with my family, and every time I am here it feels like I am reliving those memories. I love that there is always something to do in Duluth, even when you are on your own. For example, you can take a peaceful walk around campus or through Bagley Nature Area. That one-on-one time gives you a chance to slow down and focus on yourself. I also appreciate how much of the UMD campus is connected indoors, which makes it easy to get around without stepping outside. This is especially nice during the winter or on rainy days.</p>

          <h2>My Campus Experience</h2>
          <p>When I first started college, I really struggled because it was my first time being away from home for what felt like forever. After meeting some great people and getting used to life at UMD, things became much easier, and I found myself excited to return to campus after trips home during the school year. During my first year, I lived in Ianni Hall, which was one of the nicer dorms. This year, I am living in Heaney Hall with three of my friends. I also have a car on campus now, so whenever I need a break from school, I like to go on drives to clear my mind and focus on other things. I originally came to college planning to major in Business Management, but this summer I decided to change my major to Accounting.</p>
